# zeam - Zig Beam Client

Beam Chain is a futuristic ZK based Ethereum Consensus Protocol first [unveiled in Devcon 7 Bangkok Thailand, Nov 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjuenkv1zrw)
and is meant to upgrade the current Beacon Chain when ready. Zeam is its production grade implementation (wip).

The heart of Beam Chain is to massively scale and decentralize ethereum consensus with provable and verifiable
protocol via ZK-VMs but also bundles some of the disruptive ideas and learnings on ethereum consensus which are a
bit harder to incrementally implement on the current Beacon Chain.

## Client Development

As is the ethos of ethereum community, beam protocol and specs will be developed in open. Zeam will not only
translate those specs to an production grade zig client but also actively contribute to development of those
specs.

We also will collaborate actively with other Beam clients and collectively will push the protocol to maturity
for consideration and deployment to ethereum blockchain.

We are currently doing various POCs/lib development:

 - [POC of zig run time](https://github.com/blockblaz/zeam-runtime) with various ZK-VMs.
 - [Snappy](https://github.com/blockblaz/zig-snappy) & [Snappy frames](https://github.com/blockblaz/snappyframesz)

As we go along, we will also be maintaining important [resources](./resources/) related to beam protocol, ZK and
ZK-VMs, and quantum security & updates.

### Zig Ecosystem

Zig despite being relatively new is an upcoming ecosystem stack for ethereum protocol. We will aim to further push
the stack towards maturity via our modular client approach as well as independent libraries development and
contribution.

Please reach out to us if you are actively enagaged in developing a library in the ecosystem that you may think
we can use and/or contribute to.
